    1. Example:\\
        Context: The master's program in Data and Computer Science includes an application area. Annex 3 lists the possible application areas. Upon request, the examination board can also approve a different application area. - Master Data and Computer Science \\
        Question: I study Data and Computerscience. Can I choose application areas that are not listed? \\ \\
    2. Example: \\
        Context: (5) The final failure in a mandatory module leads to the loss of the examination claim. In elective mandatory modules, if provided for in the module handbook, the failure can be compensated for by the successful completion of another elective mandatory module or another performance within the respective module. ยง 4 Paragraph 2 remains unaffected. - Bachelor Physics \\
        Question: When does the failure of an exam lead to the termination of the study? \\ \\
    3. Example: \\
        Context: (3) The application must be made in writing to the examination board.

The burden of proof for the existence of equivalence in non-academic achievements lies with the applicant. - Bachelor Philosophy \\
        Question: What would happen, if I can't provide information on my academic achievements?\\ \\
    4. Example: \\
        Context: The intermediate examination consists of successful participation in the exercises for beginners in the subjects Civil Law, Public Law, and Criminal Law. The partial performances of the exercise (homework and supervisory work under examination conditions) must in principle be performed in the exercise of a semester; ยง 4 paragraph 5 remains unaffected. - Civil Law\\
